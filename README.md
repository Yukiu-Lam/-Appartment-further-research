### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a undergraduate student from University of Toronto. I major in Cells and system biology and statistics. 

####  Content
Several previous research indicated that the aging plumbing systems, floor structure, and heating systems lead to indoor noise decreasing the insulation performance of walls respectively. The data set is pulled from open data Toronto and analyzed using multiple linear regression with the corrected assumptions and low variance inflation factor. Unlike the previous research, apartments with higher age did not actually affect the inspection scores of these mentioned aspects of the apartments in Toronto. In this paper, I only apply power transformation using the Box-Cox method and most of the responses failed to be explained using the reduced model. Using a different stratification method or alternative transformation may improve the model

#### Repo Details
Details in output/paper.pdf

simulation dataset is 'scripts/00-simulation.R'

Raw data 'inputs\data\Apartment_Evaluation.csv'
cleaned data 'inputs\data\cleaned data.csv'
Datasheet: 'inputs\data\datasheet.Rmd'

The code for cleaning is â€˜scripts/01-clean.Râ€™ and output to â€˜outputs/data/cleaned data.csvâ€™.
